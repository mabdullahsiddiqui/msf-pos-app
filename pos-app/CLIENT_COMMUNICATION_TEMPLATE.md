## Option 1: Professional Explanation

**Subject: Application Deployment - Server Configuration Required**

Hi [Client Name],

I've completed the POS application development and it's ready for deployment. The application uses .NET 8.0, which is Microsoft's latest and most modern web development platform.

**Why .NET 8.0?**
- Industry-standard technology used by major companies
- Better performance and security than older technologies
- Unified codebase (frontend + backend) = easier maintenance
- Free and open-source (no licensing costs)
- Works perfectly on your current hosting

**Current Status:**
The application is fully built and ready. We just need hosting support to configure one server setting (Application Pool) - this is a standard 5-minute task they do regularly.

**What We Need:**
Could you please open a support ticket with HosterPK and ask them to:
"Please configure the Application Pool for softxonepk.com to use .NET CLR Version 'No Managed Code' and Integrated Pipeline Mode for ASP.NET Core 8.0 application."

This is a routine configuration that takes 5 minutes. Once done, the application will be live.

**Alternative:**
If you prefer a different technology, we would need to rewrite the entire application from scratch, which would take several weeks and additional costs.

Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Option 2: Simple Explanation

**Subject: Quick Fix Needed for POS Application**

Hi [Client Name],

The POS application is ready and just needs one server setting changed by hosting support.

**The Issue:**
The hosting server needs a 5-minute configuration change (Application Pool setting). This is standard for .NET applications.

**What You Need to Do:**
1. Open a support ticket with HosterPK
2. Ask them: "Please set Application Pool for softxonepk.com to .NET CLR Version 'No Managed Code' for ASP.NET Core 8.0"

**Why .NET?**
- Modern, fast, secure technology
- Used by major companies worldwide
- Free and works on your hosting
- Application is already built and ready

Once they make this change, the application will work immediately.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

## Option 3: Technical Brief

**Subject: Deployment Status - Server Configuration**

The application is deployed but requires a server configuration change.

**Technology Stack:**
- .NET 8.0 (Microsoft's latest framework)
- Blazor WebAssembly (modern web technology)
- Standard Windows IIS hosting

**Required Action:**
Hosting support needs to configure Application Pool settings. This is a standard procedure.

**Support Ticket Template:**
```
Subject: Application Pool Configuration for ASP.NET Core 8.0

Please configure the Application Pool for domain softxonepk.com:
- .NET CLR Version: No Managed Code
- Managed Pipeline Mode: Integrated

This is required for our ASP.NET Core 8.0 application to run.
```

**Timeline:** 5 minutes after support makes the change.

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Application is Ready** - Not a development issue
2. **Standard Configuration** - Routine hosting task
3. **5-Minute Fix** - Quick support request
4. **Modern Technology** - Industry standard
5. **No Additional Cost** - Just need support to configure
